              <p className="p-5"><strong>802.11 Standards and Amendments</strong>
                IEEE 802.11 is the standard for wireless local area networks (WLAN). It defines specifications for the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) layer within the OSI model.
                As wireless technology has evolved, the 802.11 committee has introduced several amendments to the original standard. Below are some key amendments:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>802.11: The original WLAN standard.</li>
                <li>802.11a: Supports speeds up to 54 Mbit/s on the 5 GHz band.</li>
                <li>802.11b: Provides 5.5 Mbit/s and 11 Mbit/s speeds on the 2.4 GHz band.</li>
                <li>802.11g: Supports up to 54 Mbit/s on 2.4 GHz and is backward compatible with 802.11b.</li>
                <li>802.11h: Introduces regulatory requirements for power and transmission limits in the 5 GHz band.</li>
                <li>802.11i: Enhances security measures.</li>
                <li>802.11n: Increases throughput using Multiple Input/Multiple Output (MIMO), also known as Wi-Fi 4.</li>
                <li>802.11ac: Provides very high throughput below 6 GHz, commonly known as Wi-Fi 5.</li>
                <li>802.11ad: Enables multi-gigabit speeds in the 60 GHz band, also referred to as WiGig.</li>
                <li>802.11ax: Improves efficiency in wireless networks, known as Wi-Fi 6.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="p-5"><strong>IEEE 802.11b</strong>
                The IEEE 802.11b standard introduced Complementary Code Keying (CCK), enabling data transfer rates of 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, which ranges from 2.4 GHz to 2.485 GHz. This standard operates across 14 channels, each 22 MHz wide. However, due to the limited spectrum, only three non-overlapping channels are available in most regions.
                When referring to a channel frequency, the center frequency is used. The center frequency represents the midpoint of a channel‚Äôs bandwidth. For instance, channel 1 spans from 2.401 GHz to 2.423 GHz, but its center frequency is 2.412 GHz.
              </p>
              
              <p className="p-5"><strong>IEEE 802.11a</strong>
                The IEEE 802.11a standard was introduced alongside 802.11b but operates in the 5 GHz frequency band. This provides more available channels with reduced interference compared to 2.4 GHz networks. Unlike 802.11b, which uses CCK modulation, 802.11a relies on Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for transmission. This allows data rates of up to 54 Mbps over 20 MHz-wide channels.
                
                OFDM works by dividing a channel into multiple smaller subchannels, called subcarriers, which carry data simultaneously. Each 802.11a channel consists of 64 subcarriers, with 48 used for data transmission, 4 serving as synchronization pilots, and 12 left unused. Each subcarrier has a width of 312.5 KHz.
                
                As with 802.11b, the frequency allocation and power limits of 802.11a vary by country. Due to the complexity of 5 GHz spectrum regulations, channel availability may differ across regions and change over time.
              </p>
              
              <p className="p-5"><strong>IEEE 802.11g</strong>
                IEEE 802.11g builds upon 802.11b by incorporating OFDM while operating within the 2.4 GHz band. It offers improved performance and maintains backward compatibility with 802.11b devices. When an 802.11b device connects to an 802.11g network, the connection speed may drop to accommodate the older standard.
                
                The channel structure in 802.11g remains the same as in 802.11b. However, channel 14 was only available in Japan for 802.11b networks.
                
                Although 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g sometimes utilize multiple antennas, they do not support Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO). Instead, they use Single Input Single Output (SISO) technology, where only one antenna transmits and receives at a time. In these standards, multiple antennas are primarily used for antenna diversity, which improves signal reception by selecting the strongest signal available.
              </p>
              
              <p className="p-5"><strong>IEEE 802.11n</strong>
                IEEE 802.11n introduced significant advancements in both speed and range for wireless networks, operating on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. Initially, the standard allowed speeds up to 74 Mbps, with later implementations reaching up to 300 Mbps. A key improvement in 802.11n is the introduction of MIMO technology.
                
                MIMO employs multiple antennas for transmitting and receiving signals, utilizing multipath propagation to improve performance. While traditional signals degrade when bouncing off obstacles, MIMO leverages these reflections to enhance data transmission.
                
                The 802.11n standard supports up to four spatial streams, each requiring a separate antenna, allowing for greater data throughput. In commercial devices, up to three spatial streams are commonly available. Additionally, 802.11n supports 40 MHz-wide channels, doubling the data rate compared to 20 MHz-wide channels used in previous standards.
                
                A new feature introduced in 802.11n is Greenfield mode, which optimizes wireless transmission by restricting network access to 802.11n devices only. This eliminates the need to support older standards, thereby increasing efficiency.
              </p>
              
              <p className="p-5"><strong>MIMO Notation and Configuration</strong>
                The number of streams and achievable data rates in a wireless network depend on the number of antennas on both the transmitter and receiver. The standard notation for MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output) configurations follows the format t√ór:s, where:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>t represents the number of transmit (TX) chains.</li>
                <li>r represents the number of receive (RX) chains.</li>
                <li>s denotes the maximum number of spatial streams the radio can use.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="p-5">For example:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>2x2:2: 2 TX chains, 2 RX chains, and 2 streams.</li>
                <li>3x3:3: 3 TX chains, 3 RX chains, and 3 streams.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="p-5">An alternative notation format, tTrR, omits the stream count. Using this format: 2T2R corresponds to 2x2:2. 3T3R corresponds to 3x3:3.</p>
              
              <p className="p-5">The number of antennas is always equal to or greater than the number of streams. For instance, a device with four antennas might support only three streams, such as the Alfa AWUS1900 wireless adapter, which has four TX and RX chains but only supports three spatial streams (4x4:3).</p>
              
              <p className="p-5">When analyzing networks, the number of streams is crucial for ensuring compatibility with client devices. A device with fewer streams than a client cannot fully decode its communication.</p>
              
              <p className="p-5"><strong>Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) Rates</strong>
                i-Fi networks, particularly 802.11n, utilize various modulation techniques, coding rates, and spatial streams to achieve speeds of up to 600 Mbps, the maximum supported rate for most consumer devices. The MCS index is key to determining a network's data throughput.
                
                Higher MCS rates result in faster speeds but require cleaner signals. MCS index values range from 0 to 9, with each value corresponding to different modulation schemes (e.g., BPSK, QPSK, QAM) and coding rates. A higher MCS index provides faster throughput but demands higher signal quality.

              <p className="p-5">
                Wireless penetration testing tools usually require disabling network managers because they interfere with the proper operation of the tools.

              <p className="p-5"><strong>Connecting to an Access Point</strong></p>
              
              
              <p className="p-5">
                Several wireless clients exist on Linux. The most common one is wpa_supplicant, as it is commonly used by network managers across Linux distributions to connect to Wi-Fi networks, even if they don't have any encryption or still use WEP.
              </p>
              <p className="p-5">
                wpa_supplicant can either be used via a command line interface, with wpa_cli, or with configuration files containing the settings of the network. In a sample configuration file, each network connection is defined within a network item.
              </p>
              
        
              <p className="p-5">
                Connecting to a WPA-PSK network is a bit more involved. We need to add two parameters inside the network item:
              </p>
              <p className="p-5">
                wpa_supplicant will automatically choose between TKIP and CCMP based on availability, but it is possible to force one or the other by adding <code>pairwise=CCMP</code> or <code>pairwise=TKIP</code> to the configuration if necessary.
              </p>
              <p className="p-5">
                wpa_supplicant supports WPA3, OWE, and can handle WPA Enterprise networks as well; however, these are out of scope of this module. The configuration file provided with the wpa_supplicant source code provides a number of examples for various network settings, including WPA3, OWE, and WPA Enterprise.
              </p>
              <p className="p-5">
                A quick and easy alternative is wpa_passphrase. This tool can generate a configuration file for a basic WPA-PSK network. It requires at least one parameter, the ESSID. The second parameter, the passphrase, is optional, for security reasons. If the second parameter is omitted, it will prompt for the passphrase. This tool will output the content of a configuration file.

              <p className="p-5">Setting up an access point requires two distinct network interfaces and involves five steps:</p>
              <ul>

                <li>Set up a static IP for the wireless interface.</li>

              <p className="p-5">
                Ethernet is fairly easy to set up, and in most cases, we just need to get a DHCP lease like we did in the previous steps.

          When conducting wireless penetration testing, it's often necessary to disable network managers, as they can interfere with the tools being used. However, there are instances when we still need internet access or even need to share it. Although network managers can typically handle this, we will explore how to manually configure the setup, as network managers are disabled during testing. It's important to use a separate network interface from the one employed for penetration testing.
        </p>

        <p className="p-5">
          <strong>Connecting to an Access Point</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="p-5">
          Linux offers several wireless clients, with <code>wpa_supplicant</code> being the most widely used. It connects to Wi-Fi networks on many Linux distributions, even for unencrypted networks or those still using WEP.
        </p>
        <p className="p-5">
          <code>wpa_supplicant</code> can be controlled via a command-line interface (<code>wpa_cli</code>) or through configuration files specifying network settings.
        </p>

        <p className="p-5">
          This configuration allows the system to connect to an open network called "hotel_wifi" and instructs <code>wpa_supplicant</code> to scan for SSIDs first.
        </p>
        <p className="p-5">
          The tool will automatically select between TKIP and CCMP for encryption, but you can specify a preference by adding <code>pairwise=CCMP</code> or <code>pairwise=TKIP</code> to the configuration. <code>wpa_supplicant</code> also supports WPA3, OWE, and WPA Enterprise, though these are outside the scope of this tutorial. 
        </p>
        <p className="p-5">
          To simplify configuration, you can use the <code>wpa_passphrase</code> tool, which generates configuration files for basic WPA-PSK networks. This tool requires the ESSID and optionally, a passphrase. If the passphrase isn't provided, it will prompt for it and output the configuration to a file.
        </p>
        <p className="p-5">
          Using the sample configuration from above, the following commands would generate and use a configuration file (<code>wifi-client.conf</code>):
        </p>
        <code>
          sudo wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c wifi-client.conf
        </code>

        <p className="p-5">
          Once successfully connected, we can run <code>wpa_supplicant</code> in the background by appending <code>-B</code> and then request a DHCP lease with <code>dhclient</code>:
        </p>
        <code>
          sudo dhclient wlan0
        </code>

        <p className="p-5"><strong>Setting up an Access Point</strong></p>
        <p className="p-5">
          To set up an access point, you need two distinct network interfaces. The process involves five main steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Configure Internet Access on the system.</li>
          <li>Set a Static IP on the wireless interface.</li>
          <li>Set up a DHCP server to provide IP addresses to Wi-Fi clients.</li>
          <li>Add routing to enable Internet access for Wi-Fi clients.</li>
          <li>Configure the wireless interface in AP mode.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="p-5"><strong>Internet Access</strong></p>
        <p className="p-5">
          You need an active Internet connection on the system, whether through Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or mobile broadband. Use <code>iw</code> to list supported modes for your Wi-Fi interface:
        </p>
        <code>
          sudo iw list
        </code>

        <p className="p-5"><strong>Static IP on Access Point Wireless Interface</strong></p>
        <p className="p-5">
          Assign a static IP to the wireless interface intended for the access point. Example:
        </p>
        <code>
          sudo ifconfig wlan0 10.0.0.1/24 up
        </code>

        <p className="p-5"><strong>DHCP Server</strong></p>
        <p className="p-5">
          To automatically assign IPs to clients, set up <code>dnsmasq</code>. Example configuration file (<code>dnsmasq.conf</code>):
        </p>
        <pre>
        domain-needed
        bogus-priv
        no-resolv
        listen-address=10.0.0.1
        dhcp-range=10.0.0.100,10.0.0.199,12h
        server=8.8.8.8
        server=8.8.4.4
        </pre>
        <p className="p-5">Start <code>dnsmasq</code> with:</p>
        <code>
          sudo dnsmasq --conf-file=dnsmasq.conf
        </code>

        <p className="p-5">
          You can confirm it‚Äôs running by checking the syslog:
        </p>
        <code>
          sudo tail /var/log/syslog | grep dnsmasq
        </code>

        <p className="p-5"><strong>Enable IP forwarding</strong></p>
        <code>
          echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
        </code>

        <p className="p-5"><strong>Set up NAT rule using nftables:</strong></p>
        <code>
          sudo apt install nftables
        </code>
        <code>
          sudo nft add table nat
          sudo nft add chain nat postrouting type nat hook postrouting priority 100 \;
          sudo nft add rule nat postrouting oifname "eth0" masquerade

          title: "Determining Chipsets and Drivers for Wireless Attacks",
          summary: (
            <>
              <p className="p-5">
              The chipset of a Wi-Fi card and the corresponding driver are both important when it comes to penetration testing. In this module, we will review how to determine the chipset and driver for a Wi-Fi adapter, even without physical access to the hardware. This information is also useful for selecting compatible hardware.

While we might prefer to stick to a list of chipsets known to work, there may be times when we need to work with an unfamiliar adapter. Learning the wireless chipset manufacturer helps determine supported operating systems, required drivers, and any associated limitations.

Wireless cards are branded by manufacturers like Netgear, Ubiquiti, Linksys, and D-Link. These cards contain chipsets from different manufacturers such as Mediatek, Ralink, Atheros, Qualcomm, or Marvell. Unfortunately, chipset manufacturers are both more important and harder to determine, as card manufacturers do not always disclose the chipset used. Even different versions of the same model may have different chipsets.
              </p>

              <p className="p-5">
              The first step is to identify the wireless chipset used by an adapter. Several techniques can be used:
              <ul>
              Physical Inspection:
                <li>If the adapter is accessible, check for an FCC ID on a label or etched onto the metal casing.</li>
                <li>Enter the FCC ID into the FCC database to find internal device photos revealing the chipset.</li>

              </ul>

              <ul>
              Using System Tools:
                <li>Plug in the adapter and run airmon-ng to check if it displays the chipset and driver.</li>
                <li>If no interfaces appear, check loaded modules using lsmod before and after plugging in the device.</li>
                <li>Use dmesg to look for chipset-related messages or errors such as missing firmware.</li>
                <li>Filter dmesg output using terms like ieee80211, mac80211, cfg80211, wireless, or wifi.</li>
                <li>Inspect lsusb -vv output for USB devices or lspci -n for PCI/PCIe devices.</li>
                
              </ul>

              </p>

              <p className="p-5">
              Example output of lsusb -vv:

              <code>
              kali@kali:~# sudo lsusb -vv <br></br>
              Bus 001 Device 065: ID 148f:5370 Ralink Technology, Corp. RT5370 Wireless Adapter <br></br>
              Device Descriptor: <br></br>
              idVendor  0x148f Ralink Technology, Corp. <br></br>
              idProduct  0x5370 RT5370 Wireless Adapter
              </code>
              </p>

              <p className="p-5">
              In this case, the chipset is RT5370 from Ralink. The vendor ID (0x148f) and product ID (0x5370) can be searched online for more details. <br></br>
              Additional resources for identifying chipsets include: 
              <ul>
                <li>DeviWiki (WikiDevi) for a user-maintained database.</li>
                <li>The Wireless Adapter Chipset Directory.</li>
                <li>Manufacturer product pages and forums.</li>
                <li>Windows driver filenames, which may contain chipset details.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>

              <p className="p-5">
              Once the chipset is identified, determining the driver is straightforward. If DeviWiki lacks the information, the Linux-wireless wiki can help. Google is an alternative. <br></br>
              There may be multiple drivers available for the same card:
                            <ul>
                <li>Vendor drivers (often closed source) may not support monitor mode.</li>
                <li>Open-source drivers generally support monitor mode but may not be included in the Linux kernel if the chipset is new.</li>
                Examples of vendor drivers with monitor mode:
                <li>r8187: Later evolved into a mac80211-based driver.</li>
                <li>rtl8812au: Available as a package on Kali Linux.</li>
                <li>nexmon: Used for Broadcom chipsets in Raspberry Pis and other SoCs.</li> 
              </ul>
              Some FullMAC chipsets, found in embedded systems and SoCs, rarely support monitor mode, even with an open-source driver.
              </p>

              <p className="p-5">
              For an Alfa AWUS036AC USB Wi-Fi Adapter, searching for "Alfa AWUS036AC wikidevi" leads to a page containing chipset and driver details. The chipset is often listed in the specifications box. <br></br>
              By following these techniques, we can identify Wi-Fi chipsets and drivers to ensure compatibility with penetration testing tools.
